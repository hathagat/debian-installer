# wp-secure.conf
#
#
# This file includes common security considerations for wordpress using nginx.
#
# The goal is to block actions which are usually dangerous to wordpress.
# Additionally, we block direct access to PHP files and folders which should not 
# be accessed directly from a browser.
#
# Also have included exceptions for plugins that are known to require this access.
